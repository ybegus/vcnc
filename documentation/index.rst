vCNC documentation
==================

vCNC is the administrative component of PeerCache.  Using it, a PeerCache
administrator may specify and enforce security policies; monitor the health
and performance of system components; and directly manage system settings,
configuration and content.

The code is open source, and `available on github`_.
